title: Changer Devices
agents: snmp
description:
 This check fetches information about changer devices from the SNIA-SML-MIB.
 (Storage Networking Industry Association-Storage Media Library)
 It was written specifically for IBM TS3500 Tape Library, but might work for others as well.

 The changer devices return values for an operating status as well as an availability status.
 The statuses will be checked and based on the result, the check will go {WARN} or {CRIT}.
 The Media flip supported status is just informational, it will only be {CRIT} if the status cannot be read, otherwise {OK}.



 {Possible operating status results:}

 {CRIT}: other, powerOff offLine, installError, powerSaveUnknown, notConfigured

 {WARN}: unknown, warning, degraded, notInstalled, powerSaveWarning, paused, notReady

 {OK}: runningFullPower, inTest, notApplicable, offDuty, powerSaveLowPowerMode, powerSaveStandby, powerCycle, quiesced

 {WARN}: other, degraded, stressed, pridictiveFailure, starting, stopping, inService, noContact, aborted, dormant, supportingEntityInError, dMTFReserved, vendorReserved
