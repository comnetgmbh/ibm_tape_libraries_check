title: System status
agents: snmp
description:
 This check fetches information about subsystem status from the ADIC-TAPE-LIBRARY-MIB.
 It was written specifically for IBM TS3500 Tape Library, but might work for others as well.

 The library returns status values for different subsystems.
 Based on this result, the check will go {WARN} or {CRIT}.




 {Possible operating status results:}

 {CRIT}: failed, invalid

 {WARN}: degraded, warning

 {OK}: good, informational


inventory:
 One service will be created for each subsystem.
